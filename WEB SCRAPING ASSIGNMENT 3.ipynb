Make sure you spend time in Holland Park and meet the army of squirrels I was in the cheaper dorm, the one with the most beds and they’ve made it happen by stacking the beds three high, not two and there’s not a lot of room between them vertically. You can’t sit up properly, at least not on the bottom one, which I was on. In fact, I banged my head getting in.
